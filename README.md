# ScheduleMasterAUEB
Official course schedule application of the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

Schedule Master Aueb is an online application for designing and administering the courses' timetable of the Athens University of Economics and Business.
Although it was initially developed for the needs of AUEB, its architecture and implementation makes it easily adoptable to the requirements of any university.

The application is comprised of two main components, the Designer tool used by the administrator of studies to create the schedule and the Provider, which is the interface the students access to create their personalized schedule. Students can choose to display the university's entire schedule or only the courses they are interested in and export them in a handy PDF document.

The technologies used to implement this application are Php-mysql, JavaScript and AJAX.
